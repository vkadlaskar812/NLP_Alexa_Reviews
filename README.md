The model contains the feedback from 5 different alexa devices (Black Dot , Charcoal Fiber, Fire TV Stick, Black plus and Black Show). Then did a comparison between the length of review and the rating provided by the user.

Counted the frequently occouriing words and built a model to predict the review as positive or negative based on ratings , length and text of the review .
